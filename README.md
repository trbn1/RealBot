# RealBot

A discord chatbot that randomly talks with sentences generated by a deep neural network.

## Requirements

`bot.py` requirements:
* Python 3.4+
* `ConfigParser`
* `discord.py` (*rewrite* branch)

To install `discord.py` from the *rewrite* branch:
```
python -m pip install --user -U https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/archive/rewrite.zip
```

Other requirements (for training/generating sentences):
* `textgenrnn`

For model training a CUDA GPU is recommended. Training was tested on Anaconda 2018.12 with `tensorflow-gpu` 1.12.0 package.

## Usage

If you want to only run the bot, skip to second part.

### Training

1. Scrap messages history from Discord using the following [script](https://github.com/chylex/Discord-History-Tracker) and save it in the src/data folder.
2. Set proper filenames in `config.py`.
3. Set wanted user to extract in config and run `extract.py`.
4. Adjust model parameters in `train.py` or leave default ones and run the script.
5. Set desired amount of text to generate and run `generate.py`.
6. Run `postprocess.py` to improve quality of the final messages.

### Bot usage

1. Set proper channel IDs in `config.py` (Developer mode ON in Discord and right click a channel).
2. Set proper bot token (Discord Dev Portal).
3. Adjust any other setting if desired.
4. Run `bot.py`.
